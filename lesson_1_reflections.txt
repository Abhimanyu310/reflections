How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed the differences between the files
So I could see what were different
And it actually contained a typo
lol

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Becoz I will always have access to every version I ever wrote
And I can always restore the previous working version
And also finding bugs is easy

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You know when you want to commit and can commit at the best times
Cons: Might not judge the proper time to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Becoz git allows us to save any files, it includes codes and files that are related to each other
So a change in one can reflect in others too

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows all the commits
Git diff compares files in 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Becoz you are sure there is a committed version that is working

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Everything lol
